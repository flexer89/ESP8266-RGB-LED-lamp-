# RGB Lamp based on ESP8266

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create an RGB lamp that can change color according to the user's preference. The lamp will be built using an ESP8266 module and RGB LED diode. The user can control the lamp using a IR controller.
I installed LCD display in case of further improvements and development

## Building Process

1.  Gather materials - to build the RGB lamp, we will need an ESP8266 module, RGB LED diode, a breadboard, wires, IR module, battery, and a diy wooden box.
    
2.  Connect the RGB LED diode and screen.
    
4.  Program the Arduino module - the Arduino module will be programmed to receive commands from the IR controller. The program will allow the user to select a color and display simple animations like strobe, fade.
    
5.  Test and optimize - after building the system, testing will be conducted to verify that everything works as planned. If necessary, improvements and optimizations will be introduced.
